- What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Whe we initialize a repository, Git transforms a normal directory in a repository, 
adding a .git folder. After that, no commit was done yet. We need to
do it because it the .git folder stores all the information.

- How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
- What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is different from the working directory and the repository, because
the itens in the staging area are to be commited. The itens in the repository 
already have been commited and not all itens in the working directory are commited itens.

- How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

We can use the staging area to add only the files that correspond to a logical change 
and commit these files.
