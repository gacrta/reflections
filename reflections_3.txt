- When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I would want to use a remote repository when I am working with someone else or when I am 
working from more than one computer. Besides that, if the remote repo is on a cloud server,
like github, its nice to have my work backed up.

- Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Its better to pull changes manually rather than auto pull because our remote repo 
could be shared with a team and also it could also be the 'working version' of your
project, a backup to go back if things go wrong.
